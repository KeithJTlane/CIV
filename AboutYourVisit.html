	<h3>Testimonials </h3>
		<p> Convenient and quiet location between Salthill (beach) and city centre. Centre lies within 10-15 minutes walking. 
		Supermarket within 5-10min, a good café and a restaurant just around the corner. 
		The room size is adequate for 2 persons, the rooms are very well cleaned (daily) 
		and extraordinarily well looked after. The hosts, Patricia and Jimmy, are really dedicated to their guests'
		comfort. They didn't even leave out the little details, such as Europlug adaptors."</p>
